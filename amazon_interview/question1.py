"""machineCapacity is a parameter list of size n. Each individual machineâ€™s capacity is
 an integer value in the array. The efficiency is evaluated using a comparison metric:
 the sum of the absolute difference between consecutive machine capacities.
 The task is to determine whether achieving the same sum of absolute difference is possible
 by removing some machines from the sequence to streamline the operations.
 If it is possible, return the minimum number of machines required in the sequence
 to attain the same sum of the absolute difference between consecutive machine capacities.
